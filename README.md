DataLogger
==========

i swer...


anywho, this repo is for a simple data logger for FRC teams.  
At the moment it is unfinished, but it is currently being worked on.   
  
Right now how I want it to work is one will need to  

1. declare a File object in the appropriate class
2. create the logging function and the dumping function
3. add both to the data logger registries
4. have logData run somewhere continuously
5. have dumpNow run when there is an error.
